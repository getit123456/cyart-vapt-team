# Lab 1 – Advanced Exploitation

## Objective
To understand and perform advanced exploitation techniques including exploit chaining, custom proof-of-concept development, and bypassing modern defenses such as ASLR.

## Tools Used
- Metasploit Framework
- Python
- Ghidra
- VulnHub VM (e.g., Mr. Robot)

## Tasks Performed
1. Conducted reconnaissance and service enumeration on the target VM.
2. Exploited a vulnerable WordPress plugin using Metasploit.
3. Chained multiple vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution.
4. Modified a Python PoC from Exploit-DB to demonstrate exploit customization.
5. Analyzed a local binary and documented ASLR bypass concepts using ROP.

## Key Findings
- Successful XSS to RCE exploit chain achieved.
- Custom exploit modification improved reliability.
- ASLR significantly increases exploitation complexity but can be bypassed with ROP.

## Evidence
- Screenshots of Metasploit sessions are stored in `Screenshots/`
- Exploit logs and outputs are documented in `Reports/`

## Outcome
Root-level access was achieved on the target system through a chained exploitation process.

## Mitigation Recommendations
- Update and harden CMS plugins
- Enable WAF and exploit mitigation features
- Regular vulnerability scanning
