# Task 4 – Post-Exploitation & Evidence Collection

## Objective
To demonstrate post-exploitation activities, collect forensic evidence, and
maintain proper chain-of-custody.

## Tools Used
- Metasploit Framework
- Wireshark
- sha256sum
- Volatility (theoretical reference)

## Steps Performed

### Step 1: Privilege Verification
After exploitation, root-level access was confirmed.

Commands used:
whoami
id

### Step 2: Post-Exploitation Enumeration
Basic system enumeration was performed to assess impact.

Commands used:
hostname
uname -a
ps aux

### Step 3: Network Traffic Capture
Wireshark was used to capture HTTP traffic during post-exploitation activity.
The capture file was saved for evidence.

### Step 4: Evidence Preservation
The capture file was moved to a secure evidence directory and hashed using
SHA-256 to ensure integrity.

Command used:
sha256sum traffic_capture.pcapng

### Step 5: Chain-of-Custody
All evidence was handled securely and hash values were recorded immediately
after acquisition.

## Evidence Table

| Item | Description | Collected By | Date | Hash |
|----|------------|-------------|------|------|
| Traffic Log | HTTP Traffic | VAPT Analyst | 2025-12-19 | SHA256 |

## Conclusion
Proper post-exploitation practices and evidence handling are critical for
forensic validity and ethical penetration testing.
