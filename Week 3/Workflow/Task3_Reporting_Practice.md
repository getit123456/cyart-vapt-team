# Task 3 – Reporting & Stakeholder Communication

## Objective
To document technical findings in a structured and professional manner suitable
for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## Tools Used
- Google Docs
- Draw.io

## Report Structure

### Executive Summary
A high-level summary of the assessment, highlighting critical risks and business
impact without technical jargon.

### Technical Findings
Detailed explanation of identified vulnerabilities, exploitation methods, and
security impact.

### Findings Table

| Finding ID | Vulnerability | CVSS Score | Remediation |
|-----------|---------------|------------|-------------|
| F001 | SQL Injection | 9.1 | Input validation |
| F002 | Weak Password Policy | 7.5 | Enforce complexity |

### Remediation Plan
Recommendations were provided to mitigate identified risks, including secure
coding practices and stronger authentication controls.

### Visualization
A network attack path diagram was created using Draw.io to visually represent
the exploitation flow from attacker to target system.

### Management Brief
A non-technical summary was prepared to communicate risk and remediation
priorities to management.

## Conclusion
Effective reporting bridges the gap between technical findings and business
decision-making, enabling informed risk management.
