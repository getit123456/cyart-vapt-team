# Week 3 – Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing (VAPT)

## Overview
Week 3 focuses on hands-on Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) activities. The tasks cover advanced exploitation techniques, web application security testing, professional reporting practices, post-exploitation evidence handling, and a full capstone VAPT cycle aligned with PTES methodology.

All activities were performed in a controlled laboratory environment for educational purposes.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Kali Linux
- Metasploit Framework
- OpenVAS (Greenbone)
- Burp Suite
- Wireshark
- Nmap
- DVWA
- Metasploitable2
- Google Docs
- Draw.io

---

## Target Systems
- **Metasploitable2** – `192.168.56.102`
- **Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)**

---

## Tasks Covered

### Task 1: Advanced Vulnerability Exploitation
- Network discovery and service enumeration using Nmap
- Identification of vulnerable services
- Exploitation using Metasploit (vsftpd, Samba)
- Root-level shell access verification
- Documentation of exploit workflow


---

### Task 2: Web Application Penetration Testing
- DVWA setup and security level configuration
- Manual SQL Injection testing
- Reflected XSS exploitation
- Burp Suite request interception and session analysis
- Vulnerability documentation and impact analysis

---

### Task 3: Reporting & Stakeholder Communication
- Creation of professional penetration testing reports
- Executive summary and technical findings
- Vulnerability findings table with CVSS scoring
- Remediation planning
- Network attack path visualization using Draw.io
- Non-technical management briefing

---

### Task 4: Post-Exploitation & Evidence Collection
- Post-exploitation validation and system enumeration
- Network traffic capture using Wireshark
- Evidence preservation and integrity verification
- SHA-256 hashing for chain-of-custody
- Ethical cleanup and session termination

---

### Task 5: Capstone Project – Full VAPT Cycle
- Full PTES-aligned VAPT lifecycle
- Discovery, enumeration, and vulnerability detection
- OpenVAS vulnerability scanning
- Manual exploitation using Metasploit
- Remediation recommendations
- Verification and risk reduction
- Professional PTES report and management summary

---

## Evidence Handling
All evidence collected during testing was:
- Captured in a controlled lab environment
- Preserved with cryptographic hashing (SHA-256)
- Stored securely to maintain chain-of-custody
- Used strictly for academic and training purposes

---

## Key Learnings
- Practical exploitation of real-world vulnerabilities
- Web application security testing techniques
- Professional security reporting and communication
- Post-exploitation evidence handling and forensics awareness
- End-to-end execution of a complete VAPT engagement

---

## Disclaimer
This project was conducted strictly for educational purposes in a controlled environment. No unauthorized testing was performed against live systems.
